There are several reasons why data could be not easy to process by traditional means. \n",

    "<b>Bias:</b> We can estimate the bais by taking bootstrap samples of our data (resampling), building many of each  polynomial model, and useing these models to calculate average predicted values for each type of model. By comparing average predicted values of data to the actual values, we can determine how off our model is on average. If the average prediction values are very different from the actual values, bais is high. If they are similar, bais is low.\n",
    "$$E[H(x^*)] - f(x^*)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Variance:</b> We can estimate the variances through a similar bootstrapping process. For each polynomial model, we can measure how consistent the predictions are from one bootstrap to the next. If the predictions for an example are all similar (tightly clustered), the variance is low. If they are dispersed, the variance is high. We can use the expected value formula for variance for the calculation: \n",
    "$$E[(h(x^*) - E[h(x^*)])^2]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Error:</b> The error can be evaluated by running our predictions on a held out test set, then evaluating how far off we are. Because the model was not trained on this held out set, it will (likely) not be impacted by overfitting.  We can then compare the error of each polynomial and select the model with the least error on the held out test set. As shown in lecture and class readings, a similar result can be obtained by minimzing the $bais^2 + variance$.\n"
