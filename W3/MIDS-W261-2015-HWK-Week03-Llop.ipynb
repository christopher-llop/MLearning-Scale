    "<span style=\"color:green\"><b>Answer:</b></span>\n",
    "1. A merge sort occurs when we are combining several datasets that are already sorted. Because the data has been sorted, we can simply look at the \"top\" element of every dataset to see which one comes next in order. The combined dataset can easily be created, in sorted order, by repeating the process of evaluating the top sorted element of the datasets being merged. This can occurs in Hadoop when data is sent from multiple mappers to a single reducer. Ultimately, each reducer will get a sorted list of the keys assigned to that reducer. However, these keys come from multiple mappers. By using a merge sort, Hadoop can more quickly present each reducers with the correct keys in sorted order.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A combiner in Hadoop occurs after the mapper but before the reducer. While it is useful to think of the combiner occuring directly after mapping, in some instances combiners can run reducer-side. The combiner will take records leaving the mapper and combine certain records together to decrease the load over the network. We are not assured that the combiner will run on any given data, so the combiner's output must be in the same format as the mappers output so that the reducer can input data from either a combiner or mapper seamlessly. Note that a different kind of combiner, called an in-memory combiner, can be set up <i>within</i> a mapper itself. In this instance, the mapper combines records in memory and then outputs periodically (perhaps when memory is running low).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. One example of a combiner is in the basic \"word count\" problem. If a mapper outputs a key-value pair for each word encountered, with a count of \"1\", the combiner can then sum these records together. For example, multiple counts of \"dog 1\" can be combined into \"dog 5\". Note that combiner functions must be communiative and associative in a way that enables the mathematics of the reducer to function correctly even though values have been aggregated. An average, for example, cannot be done in the combiner (without some work arounds) because the average of averages is not the same as the average of an entire series.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The Hadoop shuffle refers to the many steps that occur between the mapper and reducer (and sometimes the combiner). The shuffle has been refered to as the \"heart and soul\" of Hadoop, because this is the process that takes the parallelized mapper output, groups by key, and presents the correct keys to each reducer. It is possible to optimize during this process - for example, by splitting the workload of reducers so that heavily-used keys are not sent to the same reducer, we can reduce stragglers. This entire process of optimization and network traffic is included in the phrase \"Hadoop shuffle\".\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The Apriori algorithem is a method of identifying groups of items that are popular in a basket of goods. These nouns can be generalized to any situation where we are finding groups of things similar to items that are subsets of things similar to baskets. In the Apriori algorithem, we are given a required level of support (say, N = 100) that we must have to consider a group of items meaningful. To save processing time, we first create a frequency count for any ONE item. For all items that occur in greater frequency than our threshold, we then cound PAIRS of items (both parts of the pair must have N > threshold). Because we are subsetting, we need to store data for many fewer pairs than we otherwise would. We can continue this algorytehm forward, building triples off of pairs that pass the threshold, etc.  Ultimately, we can then use our final set of items to calculate confidence scores. That is, given item X, what are the chances a customer would also want item Y? (Pr(Y|X)) or Given items X and Y, what are the chances of Z (Pr(Z|(X & Y))). For more information on this calculation, see the code implemented below. In my domain, this method could be generalized to investigating what groups of academic experts are used together in a lawsuit (though I'm sure many other uses exist).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The <b>confidence</b> of a rule is defined as Pr(C|A) = Pr(A & C) / Pr(A). Intuitively, this takes the number of times A and C appear together out of all the times A appears. \"Confidence\", as a term, hints at the meaning - out of all the times we see A, how confident can we be that we will also see C? The <b>lift</b> of a rule is defined as the Confidence / the Expected Confidence, or Lift = Pr(C | A) / Pr(C). In this case, when A and C never appear together, this fraction will reduce to Pr(C) / Pr (C) = 1. The larger the lift is above 1, the more often the items appear together - and the better the rule."

The code below solves each of these problems. There are two MapReduce runs. The first calculates the number of unique products and the product frequency. The second finds the largest basket (it turns out there is a tie) and counts the frequency of each basket."

    "If we were still restricted to a single mapper/reducer pair, we would continue in the manner set forth above. We would need to violate the Apriori algorithm by creating pairs (or stripes) for all possible 3-item sets, then in the reducer we would only process those 3-item sets comprised of passing 2-item sets. In that case, the data from the mapper would leverage an additional level of inverted ordering, outputting tuples as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- (\\*, \\*, a)\n",
    "- (\\*, a, b)\n",
    "- (a, b, c)\n",
    "\n",
    "From this, can count all the a, b terms via the pre-sorted *, a, b\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this thought exercise allows us to move beyond this simple limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the Apriori algorithem using multiple Map-Reduce passes, I would first install a package such as MrJob which makes such iterative approaches more intuitive to develop. I would then, on the first pass, determine which tuples passed the threshold as was done in problem 3.2 above. The output from that reducer would be a single line file listing the tuples that passed the check as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- DAI93865 FRO40251 [tab] GRO85051 FRO40251  [tab] GRO38636 FRO40251 (etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This file (which could also be stored as a list and passed to the next iteration) would be loaded into the mappers on the second iteration and saved as a dictionary. Because these list of tuples have been filtered using the threshold, it is reasonable to believe they would fit in memory (for extremely large datasets this assumption could be revisted). Then, when processing in the mapper, only pairs present in the dictionary would be output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process could be repeated as many times as needed to create larger itemsets via Apriori.\n"
